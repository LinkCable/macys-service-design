# Macy’s Service Design Demo

This is a demo environment to walk around the store layout we designed for Macy’s as part of a project with them in our service design class to envision to shopping experience in five years.

The key features are a wider shopping space, and fitting rooms at the end of the visit so you can try everything on at once and then leave with the items you intend to purchase.

3D model of the store created in SketchUp by my partner in this project, the talented <a href="https://www.lauranesaliou.me/">Lulu Saliou</a>.

### Directions

WASD to move, as usual. You can even walk, holding LShift, and jump with Space. No real reason for that tho.

### Try It Out

You can play it <a href="https://macys.philkt.me">here</a>.
